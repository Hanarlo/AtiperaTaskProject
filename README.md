**GitHub Repository API Client**

👋 Hello there! Welcome to the AtiperiaTaskProject. This project was developed to fulfill the requirements outlined in the recruitment task from Atipera. In this README, I'll guide you through the project, its features, and how to interact with it. Let's get started! 🚀

## Introduction

This project is a GitHub Repository API Client that allows you to interact with the GitHub API to retrieve repository information based on specific criteria. The primary objective is to list repositories, their owners, branches, and last-commit information.

## Features

🔍 **Search by Username:** Retrieve repositories for a specific GitHub user.

❌ **404 Handling:** If a user doesn't exist, the API will respond with a user-friendly 404 message.


## Usage

Interacting with the API is a breeze! You can use tools like `curl`, `Postman`, or your preferred HTTP client.

You'll receive a JSON response or a user-friendly 404 error.
## Acknowledgments

A big shoutout to the Atipera team for providing the inspiration and opportunity to create this project!
